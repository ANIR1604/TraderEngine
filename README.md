# Trading Engine in Rust

Welcome to the Trading Engine project! This project aims to build a trading (matching) engine from scratch using Rust. Throughout this project, we will cover fundamental Rust concepts and develop a robust order book and matching engine to handle market and limit orders.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a fully functional trading engine with the following features:

- **Order Books**: Manage and maintain order books for different trading pairs.
- **Matching Engine**: Match buy and sell orders efficiently.
- **Order Types**: Support for market and limit orders.

## Rust Fundamentals Covered

1. **Basic Syntax and Data Types**: Understanding Rust's syntax and basic data types.
2. **Ownership and Borrowing**: Mastering Rust's unique ownership and borrowing system.
3. **Concurrency**: Implementing safe concurrent operations in Rust.
4. **Error Handling**: Using `Result` and `Option` for robust error handling.
5. **Collections**: Utilizing vectors, hash maps, and other collection types.
6. **Traits and Generics**: Leveraging traits and generics for flexible and reusable code.
7. **Asynchronous Programming**: Implementing async operations for non-blocking tasks.
